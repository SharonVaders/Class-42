| Balance                       | The rules of a game should be balanced. This means if the game is too difficult, people will not play it. If the game is too easy, people will not find it challenging enough to spend time on it. |
| Adaptivity                    | A good game is also adaptive - normally their difficulty level keeps increasing as the player plays the game. |
| Chance versus Skill           | A good game play has some elements of chance and some elements of skill involved. |
| Feedback                      | Another very good characteristic of games is that they give immediate feedback to the player on how they are doing. |
| Story                         | Lastly, all games tell a story. Some games tell a story made by the game designers. Other games allow the player to infer a story through gameplay. |
